# IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
This project uses a pre-trained deep learning model to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and the web interface is powered by Streamlit. Users can input a movie review, and the model will predict whether the review has a positive or negative sentiment.

## Project Overview
The model is trained on the IMDB movie review dataset, which contains 25,000 movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative. The model is a binary classifier that uses ReLU activation to make predictions based on the text input.

The web app allows users to:

Input a movie review
Classify the sentiment of the review as positive or negative
See the prediction score (probability) of the sentiment

## Tech Stack
TensorFlow / Keras: Used to build and train the sentiment analysis model.
Streamlit: Provides a simple web interface for the app.
